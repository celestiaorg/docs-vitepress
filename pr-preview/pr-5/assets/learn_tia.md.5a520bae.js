In the modular era, developers no longer need to issue a token to launch their own blockchain.</p><p>Similarly to ETH on Ethereum-based rollups, developers may opt to bootstrap their chain quickly by using TIA as a gas token and currency, in addition to paying for data availability. In this mode, developers can focus on creating their application or execution layer, instead of issuing a token right away.</p><h3 id="proof-of-stake" tabindex="-1">Proof-of-stake <a class="header-anchor" href="#proof-of-stake" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Proof-of-stake&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As a permissionless network built with Cosmos SDK, Celestia uses proof-of-stake to secure its own consensus.
